## Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial phase of data preparation ,the following tasks are performed

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Finding missing Values
3. Data cleaning and Formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the call centre data to find KPI's such as Total Number of calls received,Total Call Duration in hours and minutes,Average Call Duration in minutes and Response time Percentage.

## Data Analysis
Data is analysed on different parameters such as Total Calls by Day,Total Calls by State,Top Reason for Calls,Total Calls by Channel,Total Calls by Sentiment and Total Calls by Call Centre.

## Summary of Findings
###  The analysis is summarized as follows

1. KPI's for the month of October 2020 is calculated.
2. More number of calls received are on Thursday's and Friday's of the week.
3. California and Texas are the cities from where more calls are recived.
4. In the sentiment analysis, more negative responses from the customers are recorded for this month.
5. Billing Questions are found to be the reason for more number of calls.
6. The channel through which more services are sought by customers is the callcentre.
7. Los Angeles is the call center location where more number of calls are received.

## Recommendations

1. As the previous months data is not available KPI performance cannot be compared.
2. Based on the data available,it is found that Billing Questions are found to be the reason for more number of calls, so a clear document be shared with the customers which should contain the answers to their maximum questions,which may result in less number of calls and also the customer service agents can focus on others issues repoerted by the customers.
3. Ther are more negative responses received by the customers,should put more effort to improve it.

## Limitations
As the feedbacks are not answered by most of the customers,there are lot of missing values in the feedback column , so the column is omitted.
